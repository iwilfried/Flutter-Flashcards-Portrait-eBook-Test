## Environment Set-Up 

?> What’s Flutter?  

Google's New Mobile UI Framework for iOS & Android  

<p>Developed by Google, Flutter is a mobile app SDK, which allows developers to develop high-quality native interfaces for iOS, Android, Web, macOS, and Linux devices using a single codebase. It allows developers to write a code once and use it on different software devices.</p> 

Flutter is a free and open-source framework. The amazing features of Flutter enhance the mobile app development experiences.

Therefore, Flutter is the best choice for every startup.


### Minimum Requirements

- Operating Systems: Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit)
- Disk Space: At least 400 MB.
- Tools: Flutter depends on these tools being available in your environment.
- Windows PowerShell 5.0 or newer (this is pre-installed with Windows 10)
- Git For Windows

### Installing Chocolatey

?> On windows, the easiest way to install Flutter is via the package manager <strong>Chocolatey</strong>.   

> **Step 1:** `Open the Start Menu`    
Click the *Windows* Key. This opens the Start Menu  

> **Step 2:** `Find Powershell`  
Type *PowerShell* into the Search Field.  
PowerShell should appear at the top of the menu.  

> **Step 3:** `Open Powershell as an Administrator`  
Right-click on the Powershell icon. A context menu will appear. 

> **Step 4:**  `Select **Run as Administrator**` and say yes to changes to your PC.</br>
You'll see the message:</br> 
<i>PowerShell 7.2.2</i>    
<i>Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation</i>  
https://aka.ms/powershell  
Type 'help' to get help.   

> **Step 5:** `Set the execution Policy`  
The command instructs PowerShell to let you run scripts for this session.</br> 
Once you close the PowerShell window, it will default back to the original execution policy.

> **Step 6:** `Run the following command` with installation in Windows Powershell    
**C:\>**Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

If you don't see any errors, you are ready to use **Chocolatey!**
> **Step 7:** `Verify Chocolatey`      
C:\> **choco  - -version**     
<i>Chocolatey v1.1.0</i>      

> C:\> **choco list -l**</br>  
  
Chocolatey v1.1.0  
chocolatey 1.1.0  
chocolatey-core.extension 1.3.5.1  
chocolatey-dotnetfx.extension 1.0.1  
chocolatey-visualstudio.extension 1.10.0  
chocolatey-windowsupdate.extension 1.0.4  
dotnetfx 4.8.0.20190930  
<strong>flutter 2.10.0</strong>  
KB2919355 1.0.20160915  
...

**With Chocolatey on your machine now**, you simply have to run:

> C:\> **choco install flutter**  
`Develop for Android Devices`  

Download the Android Studio and install it, 
which are essential while developing a Flutter app for the Android system.
